Unit One
Universally recognized as one of the greatest cuisines of the world, Chinese food in all its variety and complexity 
is unquestionably one of the finest pleasures a visitor can experience in China. 
 CULINARY DELIGHTS IN CHINA

1 Chinese cuisine is a brilliant facet of Chinese culture, which is proven by the fact that Chinese restaurants are found scattered everywhere throughout the world. Today, 

the culinary industry is developing even more rapidly than before. A decade ago, Beijing had a few thousand restaurants, while today there are over 100,000 restaurants of different sizes in the city.	

2 Regional Chinese Cuisines
It is widely acknowledged that from the Ming (1368-1644) dynasties onwards, there are eight major schools of cuisine based on regional cooking. They came from Shandong, 
Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui provinces. In addition to these traditional cuisines, the culinary industry in China has undergone great changes, 
as almost every place has its own local specialties, and as the different cuisines gather together in big cities, such as Beijing.

3 Sichuan, known as Nature's Storehouse, is also a storehouse of cuisine. Here, each and every restaurant provides delicious yet economical culinary fare.
The ingredients for Sichuan cuisine are simple but the spices used are quite different. Sichuan cuisine is famous for its spicy and hot food, yet just being hot and spicy
does not necessarily distinguish it from other hot and spicy cuisines such as Hunan or Guizhou cuisines. What is really special about Sichuan cuisine is the use of Chinese 
prickly ash seeds, the taste of which leaves a feeling of numbness on one's tongue and mouth. Besides this unique spice, Sichuan dishes are usually prepared with other spices such as chili pepper.

Using fermented bean sauce and a set of unique cooking methods, Sichuan cuisine is now famous and popular across the world. In recent years, there have appeared many more renowned r
estaurants specializing in Sichuan cuisine, such as the Tan Family Fish Head restaurant.

4 Guangdong Province is located in southern China, with a moderate climate and abundant produce all year round. As one of the earliest 
ports open to foreign trade, the province has developed a culinary culture with its own characteristics that has exerted a far-reaching 
influence on other parts of China as well as throughout the world where it is the most commonly available Chinese cuisine. 
Guangdong cuisine is famous for its seafood as well as for its originality and refined cooking processes. Various soups in this cuisine are loved by people all over the country.

5 Zhejiang cuisine is light and exquisite, and is typical of food from along the lower Yangtze River. One famous dish 
is West Lake Vinegar Fish, which looks pretty and has the delicate refreshing flavors of nature. Many Chinese restaurants in China, 
as well as in other parts of the world, serve this dish, but often the flavor is less authentic compared to that found in Hangzhou, 
capital of Zhejiang Province, which has unique access to the fish and water of West Lake.

6 Every Dish Has a Story
The names of Chinese dishes are diverse, but behind each of the famous dishes is an interesting story explaining why it is popular.
A good name can make the dish more interesting; however, some names are so eccentric that they may confuse people, both Chinese and foreigners.
If you only translate the names literally with no explanation, you could make a fool of yourself.

7 Take Goubuli steamed buns in the city of Tianjin for example. These popular buns are all of the same size and handmade. 
    When served in neat rows on a tray, they look like budding chrysanthemum flowers. The wrapping is thin, the fillings are juicy, 
    the meat, tender and the taste delicious and not at all greasy. Then, why the name?

8 There is an interesting story behind it. Goubuli steamed buns were first sold in Tianjin out 150 years ago. 
    A local man by the name of Gouzi (Dog) worked as an apprentice in a shop selling baozi (steamed buns). After three years, 
he set up his own baozi shop. Because his buns were so delicious, he soon had a thriving business with more and more people coming to buy his buns.
As hardworking as Gouzi was, he could not keep up with demand so his customers often had to wait a long time to be served. 
Impatient, some people would call out to urge him on, but as he was so busy preparing the buns, he didn't answer. 
People therefore came to call his buns Goubuli, meaning "Gouzi pays no attention." This eccentric name, however,
has had very good promotional effects, and has been used ever since. Goubuli is now a time-cherished brand name in Tianjin.

9 In Zhejiang cuisine, there is a well-known dish called Dongpo Meat. This dish of streaky pork is prepared over a slow fire 
where the big chunks of pork are braised with green onion, ginger cooking wine, soy sauce, and sugar. The finished dish is bright red in 
color and the meat is tender and juicy and, like the Goubuli buns, not at all greasy. This dish was named after Su Dongpo (1037-1101), a great poet of the 
Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), who created it when he was an official in Hangzhou. It is said that, when he was in charge of the drainage work for the West Lake, 
Su Dongpo rewarded workers with stewed pork in soy sauce, and people later named it Dongpo Meat, to commemorate this gifted and generous poet.

10 Fujian cuisine boasts a famous dish called Buddha Jumping over the Wall, the number one dish of the province. This dish is prepared with more than 
20 main ingredients including chicken, duck, sea cucumber, dried scallop, tendon, shark lip, fish maw and ham. All these ingredients are placed into a ceramic pot, 
with cooking wine and chicken broth, and then cooked over a slow fire until the meat is tender and juicy and the soup becomes smooth and thick. Then it is served with 
more than a dozen garnishes such as mushrooms, winter bamboo shoots and pigeon eggs. It is famous for leaving a lingering aftertaste in the mouth. 
The story behind the name of the specialty goes as follows:

11 Buddha Jumping over the Wall was created in a restaurant called Gathering Spring Garden in Fuzhou, Fujian, during the reign of the Qing Emperor, Guangxu (1875-1908).
It was named Eight Treasures Stewed in a Pot and the name was later changed to Blessing and Longevity. One day, several scholars came to Gathering Spring Garden for a meal.
When the dish was served, one of the scholars improvised a poem: "Fragrance spreads to the neighborhood once the lid lifts, / One whiff and the Buddha Jumps the wall,
abandoning the Zen precepts” Hence the name of the dish!

12 Warmth and Hospitality Expressed by Food
In the eyes of Chinese, what is important about eating, especially at festivals, is to eat in a warm atmosphere. 
Often the young and old still sit in order of seniority, and the elders select food for the young while the young make toasts to the elders. 
Chinese people like to create a lively, warm, and harmonious atmosphere during meals.

13 A hostess or host in China will apportion the best parts of the dishes to guests. Using a pair of serving chopsticks, 
    she or he places the best part of a steamed fish or the most tender piece of meat on the plate of the most important guest. Such a custom is still popular,
especially among the elder generation, as a way of expressing respect, concern and hospitality.

14 Such culinary customs have had a certain influence on the character of the Chinese people. In a sense, it has strengthened 
the collective spirit of the nation. At a party or a banquet, everyone first takes into consideration the needs of the group, 
with the eating process also being a time to show humility and concern for others.


15 In China, food eaten during festivals is particularly important. At different festivals, people partake of different fare. For example, 
on the eve of the Spring Festival, people in the north always eat jiaozi, meat and vegetable dumplings, at family reunions. 
This is a way of bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the New Year. The Lantern Festival is a day of celebration, 
and on this day people like to eat yuanxiao, sweet dumplings made of glutinous rice flour, to symbolize family reunion and perfection. 
At the Duanwu Festival, people eat zongzi, glutinous rice wrapped in triangular shape in reed leaves, to commemorate the beloved poet Qu Yuan (c.1339-c. 278 BC), 
who drowned himself in the Miluo River after being politically wronged. Legend has it that people at the time threw zongzi into the river in the hope that the dragon 
would not take him away. This later gradually developed into a custom of making and eating zongzi during the Duanwu Festival.

The Internet may be changing merely what we remember, not our capacity (能力) to do so, suggests Columbia University
psychology (心理学) professor Betsy Sparrow. In 2011, Sparrow led a study in which participants (参与者) were asked to record
40 factoids (小知识) in a computer (“an ostrich’s (鸵鸟的) eye is bigger than its brain,” for example). Half of the
participants were told the information would be erased (抹去), while the other half were told it would be saved (保存).
Guess what? The latter (后者) group made no effort (努力) to recall (回忆) the information when quizzed (询问) on it later,
because they knew they could find it on their computers. In the same study, a group was asked to remember both the
information and the folders (文件夹) it was stored in. They didn’t remember the information, but they remembered how to
find the folders. In other words, human memory (记忆) is not deteriorating (退化) but “adapting (适应) to new communications
technology,” Sparrow says.
In a very practical (实用的) way, the Internet is becoming an external (外部的) hard drive (硬盘) for our memories, a process
known as “cognitive offloading (认知卸载).” Traditionally (传统上), this role was fulfilled (完成) by data banks (数据库),
libraries (图书馆), and other humans. Your father may never remember birthdays because your mother does, for instance
(例如). Some worry that this is having a destructive (破坏性的) effect on society (社会), but Sparrow sees an upside (好处).
Perhaps, she suggests, the trend will change our approach (方法) to learning from a focus on individual (个别的) facts and
memorization (记忆) to an emphasis (重点) on more conceptual (概念性的) thinking—something that is not available (可用的) on the
Internet. “I personally (个人) have never seen all that much intellectual (智力的) value in memorizing things,” Sparrow
says, adding that we haven’t lost our ability to do it.
Still other experts say it’s too soon to understand how the Internet affects our brains. There is no experimental (实验的)
evidence (证据) showing that it interferes (干扰) with our ability to focus (集中), for instance, wrote psychologists
Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons. And surfing the web exercised (锻炼) the brain more than reading did among
computer-savvy (精通计算机的) older adults in a 2008 study involving (涉及) 24 participants at the Semel Institute for
Neuroscience (神经科学) and Human Behavior (人类行为) at the University of California, Los Angeles (加州大学洛杉矶分校).
“There may be costs (代价) associated with our increased (增加的) reliance (依赖) on the Internet, but I’d have to imagine
that the overall (总体的) benefits (好处) are going to outweigh (超过) those costs,” observes psychology professor Benjamin
Storm. “It seems pretty clear that memory is changing, but is it changing for the better? At this point, we don’t know.”

Teenagers (青少年) are paradoxical (矛盾的). That’s a mild (温和的) and detached (冷静的) way of saying something that parents
often express with considerably (相当) stronger language (语言). But the paradox (矛盾) is scientific (科学的) as well as
personal (个人的). In adolescence (青春期), helpless (无助的) and dependent (依赖的) children who have relied (依靠) on grown-ups for
just about everything become independent (独立的) people who can take care of themselves and help each other. At the same
time, once cheerful (快乐的) and compliant (顺从的) children become rebellious (叛逆的) teenage risk-takers (冒险者), often to the
point of self-destruction (自我毁灭). Accidental (意外的) deaths go up dramatically (显著地) in adolescence.


A new study published (发表) in the journal Child Development (《儿童发展》), by Eveline Crone of the University of London
(伦敦大学) and colleagues (同事), suggests that the positive (积极的) and negative (消极的) sides of teenagers go hand in hand
(齐头并进). The study is part of a new wave (浪潮) of thinking about adolescence. For a long time, scientists (科学家) and
policy makers (政策制定者) concentrated (集中) on the idea that teenagers were a problem that needed to be solved. The new
work emphasizes (强调) that adolescence is a time of opportunity (机遇) as well as risk (风险).


The researchers studied “prosocial” (亲社会的) and rebellious traits (特质) in more than 200 children and young adults,
ranging (范围) from 11 to 28 years old. The participants (参与者) filled out questionnaires (问卷) about how often they did
things that were altruistic (利他的) and positive, like sacrificing (牺牲) their own interests to help a friend, or
rebellious and negative, like getting drunk (喝醉) or staying out late (熬夜).


Other studies have shown that rebellious behavior (叛逆行为) increases as you become a teenager and then fades away (逐渐消失)
as you grow older. But the new study shows that, interestingly (有趣的是), the same pattern (模式) holds for prosocial
behavior. Teenagers were more likely than younger children or adults to report that they did things like unselfishly
(无私地) help a friend.


Most significantly (最显著地), there was a positive correlation (正相关) between prosociality and rebelliousness. The
teenagers who were more rebellious were also more likely to help others. The good and bad sides of adolescence seem to
develop together.


Is there some common factor (因素) that underlies (潜在) these apparently (表面上) contradictory (矛盾的) developments? One idea
is that teenage behavior is related to what researchers call “reward sensitivity” (奖励敏感性). Decision-making (决策) always
involves balancing rewards and risks (风险), benefits (好处) and costs (成本). “Reward sensitivity” measures (衡量) how much
reward it takes to outweigh (超过) risk.


Teenagers are particularly (尤其) sensitive (敏感的) to social rewards—winning (赢得) the game, impressing (给……留下深刻印象) a new
friend, getting that boy to notice (注意) you. Reward sensitivity, like prosocial behavior and risk-taking, seems to go
up in adolescence and then down again as we age. Somehow (不知何故), when you hit 30, the chance that something exciting
(令人兴奋的) and new will happen at that party just doesn’t seem to outweigh the effort (努力) of getting up off the couch.

New building regulations (建筑法规) aimed at improving energy efficiency (能效) are set to increase the price of new homes,
as well as those of extensions (扩建) and loft conversions (阁楼改造) on existing ones.


The rules, which came into effect (生效) on Wednesday in England, are part of government plans to reduce the UK’s carbon
emissions (碳排放) to net zero (净零) by 2050. They set new standards for ventilation (通风), energy efficiency, and heating
(供暖), and state that new residential buildings (住宅建筑) must have charging points (充电桩) for electric vehicles (电动汽车).


The moves are the most significant (重要的) change to building regulations in years, and industry experts (行业专家) say they
will inevitably (不可避免地) lead to higher prices at a time when a shortage (短缺) of materials (材料) and high labour costs
(高劳动力成本) are already driving up bills (账单).


Brian Berry, chief executive (首席执行官) of the Federation of Master Builders (建筑师联合会), a trade group (行业组织) for small and
medium-sized builders, says the measures (措施) will require new materials, testing methods (测试方法), products, and systems
to be installed. “All this comes at an increased cost (增加的成本) during a time when prices are already sky high (居高不下).
Inevitably, consumers (消费者) will have to pay more,” he says.


Gareth Belsham, of surveyors (测量师) Naismiths, says “people who are upgrading (升级), or extending their home, will be
directly affected. The biggest changes relate to heating and insulation (隔热),” he says. “There are new rules concerning
(关于) the amount of glazing (玻璃安装) used in extensions, and any new windows or doors must be highly insulated.”


Windows and doors will have to adhere to (遵循) higher standards, while there are new limits (限制) on the amount of
glazing you can have to reduce unwanted heat from the sun.


Thomas Goodman, of My Job Quote, a site which sources quotes (报价), says this will bring in new restrictions for
extensions. “Glazing on windows, doors and roof lights (天窗) must cover no more than 25% of the floor area to prevent
heat loss (热量流失),” he says.


As the rules came into effect last Wednesday, property developers (房地产开发商) were rushing to file plans (提交计划) just
before the deadline (截止日期), according to Belsham. Any plans submitted before that date are considered to be under the
previous (之前的) rules, and can go ahead as long as work starts before 15 June next year.


Builders which have costed (估价) projects, but have not filed the paperwork, may need to go back and submit fresh (新的)
estimates (估算), says Marcus Jefford of Build Aviator, which prices projects.


Materials prices are already up 25% in the last two years, according to figures from the Construction Products
Association (建筑产品协会). How much overall prices will increase as a result of the rule changes is not clear. “While
admirable (令人钦佩的) in their intentions, they will add to the cost of housebuilding at a time when many already feel that
they are priced out of (被挤出) homeownership,” says Jonathan Rolande of the National Association of Property Buyers
(全国房地产买家协会). “An average extension will probably see around £3,000 additional (额外的) cost thanks to the new regs (法规).”


John Kelly, a construction lawyer (建筑律师) at Freeths law firm, believes prices will eventually (最终) come down. But not
in the immediate future (近期). “As the marketplace (市场) adapts to the new requirements (要求), and the technologies (技术)
that support them, the scaling up (扩大规模) of these technologies will eventually bring costs down, but in the short term,
we will all have to pay the price of the necessary transition (过渡),” he says.


However, the long-term effects (长期影响) of the changes will be more comfortable (舒适的) and energy-efficient homes, adds
Andrew Mellor. “Homeowners will probably recoup (收回) that cost over time in energy bill savings (节能账单节省). It will
obviously be very volatile (波动的) at the moment, but they will have that benefit (好处) over time.”
